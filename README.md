## Running bsys5 Locally

> Note: Bsys5 only works on Linux. Other platforms are cross-compiled from
> Linux.

To build LibreWolf with bsys5 locally, just install
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and then clone this
repository. Then you can just build the target you want with:

`make <TARGET>`, for example `make ubuntu22`\
(See [the above table](#targets) or `make help` for a list of supported targets.)

This will pull a prebuilt build environment from
[this repository](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/bsys5/container_registry).
If you also want to build that yourself, run `make docker-<TARGET>` first.
